Commons was a minimal city-builder web app. Users build persistent cities in an asynchronous multiplayer mosaic of 40x40 squares. Its mechanics are based on Sim City 1989.

The front end was built with React, leaning heavily on HTML Canvas and Material UI. 

The back end was built using Node.js, Express, and GCP.
